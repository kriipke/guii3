= `guii` - a lightweight window manager / terminal portable binary

`guii` provides the simplicity of a Linux vt with the power of a window manager without overdoing the complexity.
The result is a featureful terminal that is capable of copy/paste as well as displaying images, etc.

`guii` relies minimally on mouse but 
allows you to use the mouse to change the terminal selected as well as resize terminals.
